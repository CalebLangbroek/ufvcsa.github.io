   - Realworld Web Technologies: How to work with modern web technologies like Gatsby.js, React, and Node.

## Contributing

**The website is currently in development!** If you have any ideas involving:

1. **Content:** Found a typo on the website? Have an event you'd like to share with other members of the CSA? Have other content ideas? We'd love for you to contribute!
2. **Styling:** Don't like the way the site looks? Found a visual bug? We're open to suggestions and are planning on redesigning the site soon so let us know!
3. **Use-cases & Design:** Do you have an idea for a useful new feature? Do you feel like a feature on the site could be implemented better? Let's work on it!
4. **Pretty Much Anything Else**: We're open to general suggestions as well.

We've tried to design this repository to be as accessible to all as possible. Whether you've never committed to open source before, or you're an active member of the community! **We'd love for you to contribute and become part of the CSA's Open Source CommunityðŸ˜Š**.

### Getting Started

_If you're completely new to open source and GitHub, we would recommend checking out [this quick beginners guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) so you can get some background_

#### Getting Started with Gatsby (What this site is built on)

This website is built using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)

Gatsby is a Static Site Generator; In our case, this means it takes a bunch of source files, content files, and config files and compiles, minifies, and packages them together as a set of highly optimized HTML, CSS, and JS files that we can host as the website.

This allows us to develop with modern tools like React (what gatsby uses for UI), GraphQL (what gatsby uses for querying data), and markdown files with no large performance hit to the site. 

**We'd highly recommend [Gatsby's beginner-friendly tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) as Gatsby can be a lot to jump into without context**. The tutorial is aimed towards web-dev beginners so don't be afraid to give it a shot no-matter your experience!

If you have any questions or get lost along the way feel free to make an issue asking for help!

#### Choosing Where to Help

### Setting up your environment

#### Things To Install
If you're looking to contribute to the repo, there are a few things you'll need have installed:

1. [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/): Node.js is a javascript runtime that allows you to write javascript that runs directly on your machine through the Node runtime (as opposed to in a browser). 
2. [**NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/): NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for node and is used to handle dependencies for node-based projects. It is usually included in Node.js
3. [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/): Prettier is a code formatter plugin that we use to standardize our code styling. Prettier integrates with your IDE and will automatically format your code to match this repos preferred style (see .prettierrc)
4. [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/): As this is a git repository, you'll need the version control software git. If you're new to git, we'd recommend starting with a GUI like [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) to lessen the learning curve.
5. **IDE**: Last, but not least, you'll need an editor to make changes to the source files in. Use whatever you like as long as it has a prettier plugin.
